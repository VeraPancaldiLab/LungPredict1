Profiling the Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) microenvironment by integrating transcriptomics to uncover potential  phenotypic profiles associated to patterns in immune infiltration

Introduction
Identify patient tumor phenotypic profiles with transcriptomics data associated with different clinical traits. 

Datasets (Bulk RNASeq data)
LungPredict dataset: 62 patients with Lung Cancer (Adenocarcinoma) - Stage I, II, III, IV
Vanderbilt dataset: 76 patients NSCLC (Adenocarcinoma) - Early Stage
ImmunoPredict dataset: 19 patients NSCLC (Adenocarcinoma) - Late Stage

Methodology
- Differential Gene expression
- Deconvolution
- TFs inference
- Feature selection
- Clustering algorithms
- Data visualization

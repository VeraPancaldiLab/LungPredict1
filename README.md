# LungPredict 

Profiling the Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) microenvironment by integrating transcriptomics to uncover potential  phenotypic profiles associated to patterns in immune infiltration

## Introduction
Identify patient tumor phenotypic profiles with transcriptomics data associated with different clinical traits. 

## Datasets 
Bulk RNASeq data from NSCLC patients 
- LungPredict dataset: 62 patients with Lung Cancer (Adenocarcinoma) - Stage I, II, III, IV
- Vanderbilt dataset: 76 patients NSCLC (Adenocarcinoma) - Early Stage
- ImmunoPredict dataset: 19 patients NSCLC (Adenocarcinoma) - Late Stage
Single-cell RNAseq data 

## Methodology
- Differential Gene expression
- Deconvolution
- TFs inference
- Feature selection
- Clustering algorithms
- Data visualization
- Univariate Linear model

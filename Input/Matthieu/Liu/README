clinically annotated cohort of patients with melanoma (n=144) treated with anti-PD1 ICB, with whole-exome and whole-transcriptome sequencing of pre-treatment tumors.

Whole-transcriptome sequencing data from FFPE tissues were aligned using STAR74 and quantified with RSEM75 to yield gene-level expression in transcripts per million (TPM). For RNA-seq quality control, sequencing- and alignment-specific metrics were considered for each sample. The following alignment metrics (output by the STAR alignment method) were considered: percentage of uniquely mapped reads, average mapped read length, number of splices, mismatch rate per base, percentage of multimapped reads, percentage of reads mapped to too many locations, percentage of unmapped reads due to too many mismatches, percentage of unmapped reads due to reads being too short and percentage of unmapped reads due to other reasons. Additionally, we considered the raw number of reads, the average read length, the read duplication rate and DV200 for each sample. Samples were clustered across quality-control metrics using principal-component analysis, and outlier samples were manually evaluated and discarded. Three samples were removed owing to poor quality: patient 143 was excluded owing to an abnormally low absolute number of reads (number of reads <1 million); patient 107 was excluded owing to an abnormally high percentage of reads mapped to too many locations (>10% of reads), likely indicating high numbers of short or degraded reads; and patient 61 was excluded owing to multiple aberrant quality-control metrics resulting in overall poor quality when considering all metrics in aggregate as well as an aberrant expression profile compared to all other samples. Only transcriptomes from tumors whose WES also passed quality control were included; the final patient cohort for RNA-seq analysis included n=121 transcriptomes.

We performed transcriptomic and immune profiling on 158 tumor biopsies from melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy (n = 63) or combined anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 (n = 57).


Responders were defined as patients with a RECIST response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) of greater than 6 months with no progression, and non-responders as progressive disease (PD) or SD for less than or equal to 6 months before disease progression.


To better understand the biology of response to anti-PD-1 monotherapy, we performed a multi-factor design analysis to first identify genes that were differentially expressed between responders and non-responders at baseline (pre-treatment [PRE]; n = 22 biopsies from 22 responders, n = 19 biopsies from 19 non-responders with expression data), and subsequently to investigate the expression of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at early during therapy (EDT) (n = 5 biopsies from 5 responders; n = 4 biopsies from 4 non-responders).
